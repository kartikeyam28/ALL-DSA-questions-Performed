# 🚀 Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) – Solved Problems & Implementations
During my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey, I have practiced and implemented a wide variety of questions covering the essential concepts required for problem-solving and competitive programming. These questions reflect my ability to understand problem statements, design efficient algorithms, and write optimized code with proper logic and clarity.

I have worked on fundamental problems such as arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, and recursion, gradually moving towards advanced topics like trees, graphs, dynamic programming, backtracking, and greedy algorithms. For each problem, I focused not only on writing the correct solution but also on improving time and space complexity. This helped me develop a strong analytical mindset and the ability to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
